1) Explain REST and RESTful
    REST which stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural
    pattern for the creation of web services.
    A service, which complies with the REST constraints, is said to be RESTful.
    An API is said to be RESTful when it respects the REST architectural constraints
    and the 4 levels of THE RICHARDSON MATURITY MODEL which are defined as follows:

                            /\
                           /  \
    HYPERMEDIA            /  3 \   level 3: Hypertext as the engine of application state
                         /______\
                        /        \
    HTTP               /     2    \  level 2: Interactions with URI resources using different HTTP verbs
                      /____________\
                     /              \
    URI             /        1       \   level 1: Multiple URI based resources and single verbs
                   /__________________\
                  /                    \
    POX Swamp    /           0          \   level 0: Plain Old XML
                /________________________\

    And REST architectural constraints are:
    1. Uniform interface
    2. Client-Server
    3. Stateless
    4. Cacheable
    5. Layered System
    6. Code on demand (optional)

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)
     The architectural style for the creation of a web API is built on 4 rules:
        - Use simple URI for services
        - Use HTTP for client-server communication
        - Use XML or JSON as formatting language
        - Stateless communication

3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
    HTTP requests types, also called HTTP methods or verbs, are defined as follows:
    - GET: request data from a resource
    - PUT: send data to a server to create/update a resource
    - POST: send data to a server to create/update a resource
    - DELETE: deletes data from the specified resource
    - PATCH: updates partially a ressource
    - HEAD: same as GET but with no response body
    - OPTION: gives information about communication options

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?
    - Stateless: The server will not store any information about the latest HTTP
                request made by the client. It will treat every request as a new one.
    - Stateful: The server will store any information about the latest HTTP
                request made by the client. The client can retrieve a previous
                transaction with the server.
    - HTTP is a stateless protocol

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)
    the main differences are as follows
     _____________________________________________________________________
    | VERB | Request body | Response body | Safe | Idempotent | Cacheable |
    |______|______________|_______________|______|____________|___________|
    | GET  |   optional   |       yes     |  no  |     yes    |    yes    |
    |______|______________|_______________|______|____________|___________|
    | POST |      yes     |       yes     |  yes |     no     |    no     |
    |______|______________|_______________|______|____________|___________|

    when it comes to the way the parameters are sent. the GET method paramaters
    are usually sent through the URL, while the post request send data in the request body
    of the HTTP request. Which makes the GET less safe to use because parameters
    can be stored in the browser history.

6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
   In this order
    1- search for solutions on the net
    2- ask for the help of a person in my entourage that might have come across the same problem
    3- Try to rework my code in order to tackle the problem from another angle
