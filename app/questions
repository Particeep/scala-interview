1) Explain REST and RESTful

Rest (Representational State Transfer) is an architect that uses the HTTP protocol to present and manipulate resources,this architecture allows us to create 
distributed applications (web, web service, ..) interoperable, it is based on a number of contarintes that can be defined as a set of conventions and good practices, 
which are:

1- Separation of the responsibilities between the client (representation of the information) and the server (data processing), the exchange is done via 
the HTTP protocol and the data exchange format is generally of JSON or XML and the resources sounds identify by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier).

2- An architecture without states, concretely the API must not keep in memory of information between two request, which leads for example that one can not 
create sessions.

3- The API must have been cacheable, in other words it must manage a cache to reduce the response time, so for queries very ask to store the information 
generated by that these in a cache, then each request to regenerate it information and we provide that of the cache.

4- multilayer system, ie the systems must be independent.

5- All resources must have a unique identifier.

le RestFul se dit sur une application qui respect au mieux ces déffirente contraint, plus elle respectent les contraint plus elle est restFull

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)

we find several styles of architecture for the creation of web services.

1- the REST architecture that relies on the HTTP protocol for the exchange of information with the JSON or XML format, the resources are identified by URIs.

2- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), is an architect based on RPC (Remote Procedure Call) or exchange document allows to create heterogeneous web service 
(the deffirente application that communicate are develloped by deffirente technology), the principle is to apply methods remotely, to execute them in the remote
machine is to recover the results, the message processings are generally envoloped in HTTP, one finds of this kind architecture a WSDL for the description of the
déffirent service (the service provided , the operations, the data, the exchange protocol, ...), t a UDDI to reference the defer web service.

3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)

with HTTP requests, we can implement CRUD operations

Create -> POST for creating a new resource. and every call of this request a new resource is created. the information needed to create the resource is sent 
to the body of the POST method, usually in XML or JSON format.

READ, -> GET for data retrieval, we can retrieve specific data by providing in the parameters of the GET request the identifier of the resource, or one 
or more other criteria, or recover all the resources without specifying any constraints.

Update -> PUT, modification of a resource by supplying in the body of the request the new infomrations and the idantifaint of the resource to be modified, 
the first calls of the request modifying the resource, and if throws the request at other time no change in the server.

DELETE -> DELETE, deleting a resource by providing the resource's idanizer, or deleting all resources if no constraints are set (dangerous).

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?

a protocol without states, does not manage the query history, so it processes the request regardless of the one or the other, each request is considered as a single 
single transaction. in this kind of protocol can not find a session, but in a stateful protocol, we store information from previous queries like authentication 
for example. the HTTP protocol is stateless.


5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)

the GET request allows the recovery of one or more resources, the parameters are passed with the url therefore in the header of the request, 
it is a request which does not make changes on the remote server.

the POST request allows to create a new resource, the information is sent in the body of the request, and each call of the request changes will be made 
in the remote server.

6) You can’t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?

1- conducted research on problem-specific books and research on the internet,
2- If I'm not yet finding a problem, and if I work in a team I will ask my teammate for help
3- otherwise I refer to the technical leader.
4- otherwise consult an expert in the field.
