1) Explain REST and RESTful

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)

3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)

6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?


Answers : 

1- 	REST represents a communication standard based on the HTTP protocol, that allow half duplex communication between computers systems in a 	    network, communication is always initiated by the client.

	RESTFUL is referred for web services written by applying REST architectural concept. it can be implemented with differente languages.
	In RESTFUL web service HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE can be used to perform CRUD operations

2- The architectural style for creating web api are
	Create http server that expose a web API
    Create client that consume API exposed by the server
    Use XML/JSON as formatting language
  	Specify headers for both client and server, for example the content-type, host, Authorization ...
  	Stateless communication

3- first we need to explain that http request is composed of four elements :  URL, methode, headers and body

	this is an abstract of when we use such methode i

	GET: require just URL, headers are optionals , body are not accepted ,we use this methode to read information from server
    POST: require just URL, headers and body  are optionals, we use this methode send new data to server for creation request
    PUT: require just URL, headers and body  are optionals, we use this methode to update existing data
    DELETE: require just URL, headers are optionals , body are not accepted, we use this methode to remove data from server
    OPTIONS: require just URL, headers and body  are optionals we use this methode to indicates which techniques are supported

    we can found more methodes like HEAD, PATCH ...

4-  A stateful protocol is a protocol that manage states between many requests.
    Stateless protocols do not manage state and treats every request as a new one.
    so HTTP is a stateless protocol.

5-  GET is used to read data from server, POST is used to write data to server, in CRUD operations, we use GET to read data, POST 
	to insert new data.

6- First thing, i will ask my team members if one of them know the solution, if no one know it, i will learn from  other developpers experience over the internet, from stackoverflow or i will search solutions in github
