1) Explain REST
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style defined by a bunch of constraints, in order to simplify communication between computer systems on the web(HTTP protocol).

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, number of servers, etc.)
    A Web API should follow those rules :
    *   use HTTP-protocol communication between client/server
    *   requests sent are a representation of the resources, so the formatting language can be HTML, XML, JSON, etc.
    *   be scalable (dockers)
    *   be loadbalanced

    The number of servers is potentially less important (due to loadbalanced,scalability) than high availability.
3) What are the best practices when deploying an application in the cloud
    To me, the best practices should be :
    *   security : control and monitoring authentication & authorization
    *   CI/CD
    *   multiple environnement (development, preproduction production, etc.)
    *   Containerized (Docker)

4) What are your best strength : infra ? DB ? web ?
Give us detail about it
	I estimate that I'm best at DB and Web : I'm worked on many databases and often I have assisted admin database which allowed me to better understand this field. I developed during many years on web API (REST/SOAP) from scratch.
5) Among all the projects you have worked on. Which architecture do you enjoy the most? explain why ?
	Microservices coupled with an Order Manager was really interesting.
	The first one is allows independent developments, quickly deliverable, and modular. A new developer can quickly take ownership of the project.
	The second one brings resilience to failures, a tool for supervision/monitoring on the status of orders.
